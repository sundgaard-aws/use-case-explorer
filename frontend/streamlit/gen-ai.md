Create an app using stremlit to render data returnted via a Lambda function directly (not REST/HTTP call but Lambda directly), in JSON format. It should render a complete list of all text documents returned (individual records) and when clicking a record in the UI it should display the details (individual JSON attributes) in dedicated individual text widgets. It should dynamically run through attributes found in each JSON document and render those (don't hardcode).
