Generate a high quality HTML page (index). Keep CSS and JS file separate, and make sure they are fully implemented. The page should be simple with a dotted grid like background, and the ability for the user to dynamically and easily add, resize and move widgets. Make sure that there is a button to add new widgets. Each widget should be able to present text returned from a REST call to a corresponding backend API, make sure to implement this in the JS file as well. Each widget should have a title bar with a different color than the contents of the widget. Add a header and footer to the page that will stay even when scrolling, but some general header and footer items in them according to market best practices. Make sure that the JS file is fully implemented, able to accommodate for all the features described and well made. NEVER mix HTML, CSS and JS in the same file. NEVER use HTML directly in the JS file, but instead create HTML template snippets that are hidden by default and clone this when you need the HTML. Clean code, segmentation and working code is key.

Structure contents to be presented in three sibling folders, html, css and js. Output the final structure. Create a one liner command to launch the website using a simple one line CLI/python command locally. Make sure that the code is fully implemented and not just using comments and placeholders. This is a complete production application ready for launch.
